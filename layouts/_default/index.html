                <p>Hello, I'm Ryan Bagley. I'm a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-a-network-engineer">network engineer</a>, amateur writer, and hobbyist outdoor adventurer living in the American
                West.</p>
                <p>I work at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a>, which sometimes eats up a lot of my free time. But I'm part of an awesome team and work on
                exciting projects.</p>
                <p>I enjoy writing and photographing my adventures in the outdoors so that people can see the beauty of this unique
                geographic region. There is a lot to see in the wilderness but I try to share the little snippets I have experienced.</p>
                <p>I also write about a variety of other topics that are able to steal my attention. If you enjoy thoughtful articles and
                some neat pictures from a guy running around in the wilderness then check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a> or subscribe to my <a href="/atom.xml">RSS</a> feed.</p>
